This small project provide some basic programs to understand CUDA C from basics. 
It contains the basic program such as "hello world" as well as the complex one representing the computation of sobel filter using CUDA C. 
It also provides one program representing the computation of sobel filter using OpenMP just to show the difference between the running time performance of CUDA C and OpenMP.
