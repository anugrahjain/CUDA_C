This small project provide some basic programs to understand CUDA C from basics. <br> <br>
It contains a variety of programs, i.e., from the basic one "hello world" to the complex one representing the computation of sobel filter using CUDA C. <br> <br> 
It also contains a program which shows running time performance comparison between application of sobel for edge detection using OpenMP and CUDA C.
